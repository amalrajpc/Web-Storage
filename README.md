# Web-Storage

it is the technique that allow applications to store data in the client side so you can access it or manipulate it later.

### Session Storage

Session Storage allows data to be stored in the browser that will be cleared when the session ends or tab closes. The data stored in the session storage is independent of the tab or window.

### Local Storage

The data stored in the local storage persist even after the browser is closed. We have to delete the data manually. Local storage data get shared across the windows and tabs.

### Cookie

Cookies are small bits of data stored in the user's browser and sent back to the server with each HTTP request.
